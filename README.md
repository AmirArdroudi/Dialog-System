# Dialog-System
Dialog-system is a modular, data-driven system for handling dialogs for games in Unity
This system is based on [my custom event handler](https://github.com/AmirArdroudi/unity-custom-eventhandler').
I've used [Mybox](https://github.com/Deadcows/MyBox) to organized my inspector view :)
All dialog text will be read from language.json file (you can change the source to anything you like).
